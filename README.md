>COVID MAP CHHATTISGARH

Web app made using streamlit . A covid map of my state(chhattisgarh) , India  which shows number of  recovered , active and total covid cases and updates  them in real time.

A bar graph which shows the incresase of cases over time . I also mentioned a list of the covid health centres present in the state as provided by the state government 

In the end there is a poll to which users can vote by simply tapping on the options .
